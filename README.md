# ALViS
Accurate Lung Visualization and Simulation


# Problem Defintion & Goals

![Overview of the Project Flow](https://github.com/yousefsaad0/ALViS/blob/main/figures/PFlow.png)

Given a CT-Scan for the lungs of a patient, we extract the personalized extended bronchial tree using AVATREE and the FAST framework in order to develop a computational model using OpenFOAM for airflow and gas transport in the subject-specific human lungs. The project as a whole is meant to be open-source allowing for any possible future contributions by the community.
